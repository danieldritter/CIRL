These symptoms require further evaluation to determine the underlying causes and appropriate management strategies.\\n\\nPattern Diagnosis:\\nThe diagnostic patterns identified include left side L5 radiculopathy, right side L5 radiculopathy, and left side S1 radiculopathy. These patterns suggest that the patient may be experiencing symptoms related to nerve root irritation or compression at specific levels of the lumbar spine.\\n\\nPathophysiological Diagnosis:\\nThe patient has been diagnosed with discoligamentous injuries at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels of the spine (DLI L4-L5 and DLI L5-S1).
